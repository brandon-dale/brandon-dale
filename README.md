- 👋 Hi, I’m @brandon-dale. I am currently an undergraduate student at Sonoma State University studying Computer Science.
- 👀 My main interest is AI. My particular interests within AI are in regards to how it can be used within the health-care industry, support and increase environmental protection and sustainability, and AI fairness.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Computer Vision and NLP and working on a research project on building an operational definition of AI algorithmic fairness by focusing on equity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any and all Computer Vision projects, especially if they pertain to my main interests.
